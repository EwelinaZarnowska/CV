## About
Hello, I'm Ewelina! I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and logic problems. Even as a child, I fell in love with point-and-click computer games, and later, in school, I developed an interest in numbers, statistics, charts, and tables. Now I realize that working as a data analyst has always been perfect for me, and I don't know why I pursued other studies. Anyway, at least I learned a foreign language because I studied philology. Now I am correcting my mistake and gaining skills to work as a data analyst.

In my free time, aside from enjoying exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, I read crime books and watch to crime series. Every time, I carefully analyze a story and deduce who the offender is, so I can say that I am also practicing analysis. Additionally, I play computer games, especially indie and logic games, and I engage in crafting with yarn.
